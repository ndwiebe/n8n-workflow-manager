## Why Workflow Automation Matters for SMBs

### The SMB Challenge

- **Resource Optimization**: Redeploy staff to higher-value activities

#### **Operational Efficiency**
- **24/7 Operations**: Workflows run continuously, even outside business hours
- **Consistent Quality**: Standardized processes ensure consistent outcomes
- **Scalability**: Handle increased volume without proportional staff increases
- **Integration**: Connect disparate systems for seamless data flow

#### **Business Intelligence**

## Understanding Your ROI

### Calculating Your Automation ROI

Use our built-in ROI Calculator to understand the financial impact of automation:

#### **Time Savings Formula**
```
Monthly Time Savings = (Hours per Task × Tasks per Month × Number of Workflows)
Annual Labor Cost Savings = (Monthly Time Savings × 12 × Average Hourly Rate)
```

#### **Error Reduction Savings**
```
Error Cost Savings = (Current Error Rate × Error Cost × Transaction Volume × Reduction %)
```

#### **Efficiency Gains**
```
Efficiency ROI = (Increased Output Value - Automation Costs) / Automation Costs × 100
```
